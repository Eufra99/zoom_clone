# Zoom Clone App 

Introducing Zoom Clone, a Flutter mobile application that provides a seamless video conferencing experience mimicking the original Zoom app.

Powered by the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework, Zoom Clone utilizes Firebase Auth and Firebase Firestore for user authentication and data storage, ensuring secure and reliable functionality. Employing the "jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk" package from Pub.dev, the app replicates the Zoom app's video conferencing feature, allowing users to connect and collaborate seamlessly.

By closely replicating the original Zoom app's user interface, Zoom Clone provides a familiar and intuitive experience for users. With all the Zoom app's core features integrated, Zoom Clone offers a comprehensive and reliable video conferencing solution for individuals and teams.

This project showcases the power of Flutter and Firebase in building feature-rich mobile applications with ease and scalability.
